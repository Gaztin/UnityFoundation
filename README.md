# Unity Foundation Project
Template repository for projects made in the Unity game engine

## âš  Notices for Derived Repositories
* Project settings are not tracked in this repository. On first use, Unity is going to generate default settings files, which you are going to want to add.
* In an effort to optimize start-up time and overall performance, this project assumes 0 package dependencies (including built-in packages). If something is missing, you are going to have to find the package and add it. Built-in packages (such as Audio and Physics) can be enabled by opening the Package Manager and selecting "Packages: Built-in". From there, you can find the module you are looking for and enable it.
